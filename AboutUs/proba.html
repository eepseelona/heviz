I cannot emphasize enough how crucial I consider the planning of the website's design. Crafting the design plan was a meticulous process, where I paid attention to every detail to ensure that the user experience would be seamless and visually captivating.<br/><br/>During this time, I increasingly realized that this field is my vocation. Over the past year, I have learned and grown significantly in the art and science of design. Every project I took on inspired me, and I eagerly looked forward to encountering new challenges.<br/><br/>Designing is not just a job for me; it's a passion. The harmony of creativity, colors, and shapes always mesmerizes and inspires me. The opportunity to create visual experiences and assist others in realizing their visions is highly satisfying to me.</div>

                <div class="IntroductionText_Vivi1">Welcome here, dear visitor!<br/><br/>My name is Vivien Brigitta Kiss, and I am the mastermind behind this website's concept.  In January of 2023, I came up with a website idea, that is primarily focused on aspiring writers and their careers.<br/><br/> 
                    When I was younger, I had a strong interest in books and reading. Since I have been a wattpad user for a considerable amount of time and as a result I discovered some shortcomings on the site. My goal with this idea was to address these shortcomings by focusing on emerging writers and giving them the attention they deserve. <br/><br/> I worked mainly on the front-end code for this project, but I also assisted with the design work. Come along with me on this thrilling journey as we celebrate the world of young writers and their stories on this platform!</div>

                <div class="IntroductionText_Hedi">My name is Hedda Adrienn Mayer and I am currently 21 years old. <br/><br/>In our project, my main focus was on developing the backend code using JAVA, although I also contributed to the frontend development. We worked closely as a team on the detailed development of the project and I played a crucial role in its successful completion.<br/><br/> 
                    This experience was incredibly rewarding as it exposed me to different facets of the project, allowing me to learn and grow significantly. I have enjoyed the opportunity to broaden my knowledge base and acquire new skills, all of which will undoubtedly enhance my future contributions to the project.<br/><br/> In essence, my involvement in this project has been a valuable learning experience and I'm looking forward to using the knowledge and skills I've gained to excel in future projects.

                These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter: Terms) set out the conditions of use

            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                A detailed description of the services provided by CyberRead is available on the
                website (www.cyberread.com). The Service Provider reserves the right to modify or terminate any part of
                the services without prior notice.

        <div class="container sub-container" id="pharagraph-4">
            <h2 class="title-h2">Acceptance of Publisher Search and Book Publishing</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                When you search for a publisher, you agree that any publisher may publish a book. The User will only
                receive an email informing him of the publication.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container sub-container" id="pharagraph-5">
            <h2 class="title-h2">User profile and privacy policy</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                We would like to kindly remind our users that any violation of the rules applicable to their profile the
                Service Provider will not disclose their data. However, if another user has already purchased a book
                written by a particular author, that individual's name will still be displayed on the book and the book
                will remain readable, even after that user has deleted their profile.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container sub-container" id="pharagraph-6">
            <h2 class="title-h2">Resale and individual use of books</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                Please be aware that resale, personal use or redistribution of books purchased on our website is not
                permitted. These books are purchased with the intention for the purchaser to read them for their own
                personal enjoyment.

            <h2 class="title-h2">Rights of the Publisher</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                It is important to note that if a publisher chooses to publish a book, they become the owner of the book
                and its associated rights. Therefore, if the author's profile is deleted, the publisher will still
                retain ownership of the rights to the sale. Furthermore, if the profile is deleted, the author's name
                will continue to appear on the works in question.

            <h2 class="title-h2">Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                The Service Provider shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damage resulting from the use of the
                services or any error in connection therewith.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title-h2">Privacy policy</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                The processing of personal data provided by Users when using the Services is governed by the provisions
                of the Privacy Policy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container sub-container" id="pharagraph-10">
            <h2 class="title-h2">Pricing and Charging</h2>
            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                Each book sold by CyberRead has a pricing structure that includes a 20% surcharge on the entered price
                provided by the user. This surcharge is used to control the general
                price range of books available on the site, with the objective of ensuring that the fair market value of
                the books is properly reflected on the website.
                The Service Provider holds the 20% surcharge from the increased prices, and the User holds the remaining
                amount. In the case of publication through a Publisher, the amount is transferred to
                the Publisher, who is responsible for compensating the author. For books published by a Publisher, the
                responsibility for author royalties lies entirely with the Publisher. We do not assume any
                responsibility for any failure or incomplete compensation.
            </p>
        </div>

            <p class="pharagraph mt-4">
                It is the policy of the Service Provider to reserve the right to modify the Terms and Conditions at any
                time. The modifications and the full description of the terms and conditions are available on the
                company website at any time.

                These Terms and Conditions apply to and are binding on all Users, except as otherwise specified by the
                Service Provider. The Terms and the legal relationships defined therein shall be interpreted in
